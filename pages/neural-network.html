        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They are used for identifying complex patterns in NBA game data to predict outcomes with high accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Graphs and Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>The Neural Network results are underwhelming. The model tends to reach its maximum accuracy in relatively few epochs, which is possibly due to the relatively small dataset (at least by NN standards), 
                a lack of distinguishing features, or too much colinearity within the data. Given the necessary computational costs and iteration that is required for creating a NN model, 
                the performance is far too poor to consider this method moving forward.</p>>
